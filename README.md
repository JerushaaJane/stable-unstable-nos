Five numbers are available with the kids.
These numbers are either stable or unstable.
A number is stable if each digit occur the same number of times.i.e, the frequency of each digit in the number is the same.
For e.g. 2277,4004,11,23,583835,1010 are examples for stable  numbers

Similarly, a number is unstable if the frequency of each digit in the number is NOT same. For 
e.g. 221,4314,101,233,58135,101 are examples of unstable numbers.

The output can be:
Output=Maximum of all stable numbers + Minimum of all stable numbers

Assuming that the five numbers are passed to a function as input1, input2, input3, input4, and 
input5, complete the function to find and return the output.

For example:
If input1=12, input2=1313, input3=122, input4=678, and input5=898, 
Stable numbers are 12,1313 and 678
Unstable numbers are 122, and 898
So the output should be = Maximum of all stable numbers + Minimum of all stable numbers 
= 1313+12=1325
